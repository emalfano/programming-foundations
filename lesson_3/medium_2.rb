# Question 1
=begin
Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is a unique identifier for that object.

It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be 
different objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular 
named-variable can change depending on what is done to that named-variable.

In other words, in Ruby everything is an object...but it is not always THE SAME object.

Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:

=begin
a_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
b_outer is forty two with an id of: 2152729580 before the block.
c_outer is [42] with an id of: 2152729540 before the block.
d_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
Notice that Ruby re-used the "42 object with id 85" when the value was the same.

a_outer id was 85 before the block and is: 85 inside the block.
b_outer id was 2152729580 before the block and is: 2152729580 inside the block.
c_outer id was 2152729540 before the block and is: 2152729540 inside the block.
d_outer id was 85 before the block and is: 85 inside the block.
Notice that Ruby did NOT change the id for any of the objects between outside and inside the block

a_outer inside after reassignment is 22 with an id of: 85 before and: 45 after.
b_outer inside after reassignment is thirty three with an id of: 2152729580 before and: 2152728320 after.
c_outer inside after reassignment is [44] with an id of: 2152729540 before and: 2152728280 after.
d_outer inside after reassignment is 44 with an id of: 85 before and: 89 after.
Notice that changing the values has forced Ruby to create new objects and refer to them with the original variable names.

a_inner is 22 with an id of: 45 inside the block (compared to 45 for outer).
b_inner is thirty three with an id of: 2152728320 inside the block (compared to 2152728320 for outer).
c_inner is [44] with an id of: 2152728280 inside the block (compared to 2152728280 for outer).
d_inner is 44 with an id of: 89 inside the block (compared to 89 for outer).
Notice that Ruby re-uses the objects under the hood when it can, but uses different ones for different values.

a_outer is 22 with an id of: 85 BEFORE and: 45 AFTER the block.
b_outer is thirty three with an id of: 2152729580 BEFORE and: 2152728320 AFTER the block.
c_outer is [44] with an id of: 2152729540 BEFORE and: 2152728280 AFTER the block.
d_outer is 44 with an id of: 85 BEFORE and: 89 AFTER the block.
(notice that each variable keeps its new object/object_id even when we leave the block.)

 => "ugh ohhhhh"
Notice that once we leave the block, those variables that were defined inside the block lose their meaning.

Solution 2
a_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
b_outer is forty two with an id of: 2152753560 before the block.
c_outer is [42] with an id of: 2152753540 before the block.
d_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
Notice that this works the same as before. No big surprise.

a_outer id was 85 before the method and is: 85 inside the method.
b_outer id was 2152753560 before the method and is: 2152753560 inside the method.
c_outer id was 2152753540 before the method and is: 2152753540 inside the method.
d_outer id was 85 before the method and is: 85 inside the method.
This is also the same as before. These "outers" are NOT the same variables as 
those outside, Ruby is simply re-using the objects, as these new variables have 
the same values as the ones outside.

a_outer inside after reassignment is 22 with an id of: 85 before and: 45 after.
b_outer inside after reassignment is thirty three with an id of: 2152753560
before and: 2152752300 after.
c_outer inside after reassignment is [44] with an id of: 2152753540 before
and: 2152752280 after.
d_outer inside after reassignment is 44 with an id of: 85 before and: 89 after.
As before with the block version of this exercise, when we change the values of
our "outers", Ruby uses new objects for these variables to deal with their new values.

One important difference to note is that before, we saw Ruby re-using the "42" 
object and just giving it a new value inside the block. Why the difference? 
It should become clear a couple of paragraphs later in this solution...

a_inner is 22 with an id of: 45 inside the method (compared to 45 for outer).
b_inner is thirty three with an id of: 2152752300 inside the method (compared 
to 2152752300 for outer).
c_inner is [44] with an id of: 2152752280 inside the method (compared 
to 2152752280 for outer).
d_inner is 44 with an id of: 89 inside the method (compared to 89 for outer).
No big surprise here...Ruby is re-using objects that have the same values...

a_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 BEFORE and: 85 AFTER the method call.
b_outer is forty two with an id of: 2152753560 BEFORE and: 2152753560 
AFTER the method call.
c_outer is [42] with an id of: 2152753540 BEFORE and: 2152753540 AFTER 
the method call.
d_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 BEFORE and: 85 AFTER the method call.
Wow, look at that. Even though we changed the values of our "outer" variables
inside the method call, we still have the same values and the same object id's 
down here AFTER the method call as we had before it!

This is because our method call accepts VALUES as parameters. The names we give
to those values in the definition of our method are SEPARATE from any other use
of those same names.

We used the same names there for convenience (and admittedly to build some 
suspense and allow us to clarify this point). We could just as easily have 
called the first parameter of our method definition a_Fred instead of a_outer.

The method gets the VALUES of the parameters we pass, but the parameter
variables inside the method have no other relationship to those outside of the
method. The names were coincidental, and confusing in a useful way.

=> "ugh ohhhhh"
Our main method STILL has no access to variables that are defined inside of the method.

# Question 3

# Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as parameters and see 
# how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be different.

# Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
# my_string should be "pumpkins" now
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
# my_array should be ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"] now
# the += does not mutate the string but the << does
# Summary of LS explanation:
# Ruby passes the parameter by value but the value that gets passed is a 
# reference to some object--String type, Array type. The method initializes a 
# new local variable which only lives within the scope of the method definition.
# The difference is the way Ruby handles String#+= and Array#<< operations. 
# String#+= is a reassignment and creates a new String object. The reference to 
# this new object is assigned to a_string_param, so my_string and a_string_param
# do not point to the same object.
# Array#<< Ruby uses the same object that was passed in and appends the new 
# element to it. So, my_array and an_array_param are still pointing to the same 
# object. 

# Question 4
# To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show a 
# modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the 
# caller's version of it.

def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param << 'rutabaga'
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

# my_string should be rutabagapumpkins and my_array should be ["pumpkins"] 
# because the array is reassigned by the Array#= method.

# Question 5
# How could the unnecessary duplication in this method be removed?

def color_valid(color)
  if color == "blue" || color == "green"
    true
  else
    false
  end
end

# my solution:

def color_valid(color)
  if ["blue","green"].include? color
    true
  else
    false
  end
end

puts color_valid("blue")

# LS solution: Ruby automatically evaluates statements so...
def color_valid(color)
  color == "blue" || color == "green"
end
puts color_valid("blue")
