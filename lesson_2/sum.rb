For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:
a method that returns the sum of two integers

casual pseudo-code:
given two integers
declare a variable sum to store the sum of the values
add first integer to second integer and store in sum
return sum

formal pseudo-code:

START

# Given two integers called number1 and number2
SET sum = nil
SET sum = number1 + number2

=end
number1 = 1
number2 = 2
sum = nil
puts sum = number1 + number2
