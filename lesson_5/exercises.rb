Note: the Hash#key method returns the key of an occurrence of a given value. 
A couple of things to note when using this method:

If more than one key has the same value the method returns the key for the first 
occurrence of that value.
If the requested value does not exist in the hash then nil is returned.
For this example you could also have done the following:

hsh2[:third].keys[0] # => 'g'
Although this looks very similar to the initial solution, Hash#key and 
Hash#keys are actually two completely different methods. Hash#key returns a 
single key based on a value passed to the method. Hash#keys returns an array of 
all the keys in the hash, and the [0] is then referencing the object at index
0 of that returned array.
